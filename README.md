# Anomaly Detection Algorithm Comparison in ML.NET

This Git repository is associated with the _Anomaly Detection Algorithm Comparison in ML.NET_ workshop at the [Innovation Uncaged](https://www.solarwindsmeetup.com/event/innovation-uncaged-workshops/) SolarWinds Meetup on December 12, 2019 in Brno, Czech Republic.
This workshop explores how the Microsoft [ML.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet) library helps with anomaly detection in time-series data.
We'll develop a simple framework for evaluating the quality of predictions from different forecasting algorithms.

## Prerequisites

Before the workshop, you'll need to install Git, Visual Studio Code, and the .NET Core 3.0 SDK:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* [.NET Core SDK 3.0.101](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0)

Mac and Linux users may also need to install the [Intel Math Kernel Library](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl) until issue [Unable to load shared library 'MklImports' or one of its dependencies. #3903](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/3903) is resolved.
